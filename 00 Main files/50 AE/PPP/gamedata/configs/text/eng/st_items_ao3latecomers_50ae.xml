		<text>The IMI Desert Eagle is a semi-automatic handgun notable for chambering the largest centrefire cartridge of any magazine fed, self-loading pistol and also being the heaviest and blockiest gun of its type. No one knows why IMI thought shooting a calibre of this size out of a handgun was a good idea, even though there are plenty of rounds out there that can do the job without breaking your wrist; this one assumes because of a pissing contest between the .44 and .50 AE. Not only is it heavy and harsh in recoil, you can also use it to bludgeon your enemies to death because of its blockiness and weight. Although militaries and law enforcement around the world, in their moment of sanity, never adopted this brick; Hollywood did, mostly because of its "cool factor" and now is the poster child for gangsters and pimps and a status symbol for those who reached a certain rank in a certain console shooter. Rumour is that there's a stalker with a crowbar wandering around the Zone with a rechambered version of this gun, but it's just a rumour.\n
		Due to the rarity of .50 AE ammo, models chambered in .357 are more common in the Zone.\n

		<text>A more modernized version of the Desert Eagle, with a build-in compensator and picatinny rails, on frame and slide. Knowing that so, it still has quite a recoil but much lower than any other Desert Eagle, let alone magnum, the slight barrel improvements also improve the accuracy by a bit, and it's possible to insert some scopes. It loads .50 AE rounds like the slide claims, quite the rare powerhouse in the Zone, and you caught Nimble grumbling something about "insecure clients" when he showed this gun to you.\n \n
