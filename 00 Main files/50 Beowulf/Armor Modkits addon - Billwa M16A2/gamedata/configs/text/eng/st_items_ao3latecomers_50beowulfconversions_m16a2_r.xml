		<text>The "Commando" variant of the M16A2 assault rifle is a specialized iteration renowned for its enhanced versatility and firepower. Building upon the M16A2's foundation, the Commando model integrates a 20-inch barrel with an M203 underbarrel grenade launcher, allowing operators to engage both individual targets and fortified positions with precision. This select-fire firearm retains the ergonomic advancements of the M16A2, including its adjustable rear sight for diverse engagement ranges, while the integrated M203 grenade launcher extends its combat capabilities. A detachable magazine, with a capacity of 30 rounds, further emphasizes its adaptability on the battlefield. The Commando variant stands as a testament to innovative design, catering to the multifaceted demands of modern warfare. \n
		Afer replacing some parts, this rifle now utilizes the .50 Beowulf ammunition. This increases damage, but reduces its range severely and its recoil becomes very hard to control.\n
