		<text>The Beowulf M4 is a fully automatic variant of the M4 carbine chambered in .50 Beowulf. The round is intended to improve stopping power greatly at short- to medium-range as compared to the standard 5.56x45mm NATO round. One of its advertised uses is at vehicle checkpoints, since the heavy bullet's flight path is not easily deflected by auto glass or standard vehicle body panels. Although much has been written about its tactical uses, the .50 Beowulf is gaining recognition as a sporting cartridge. It is becoming more widely recognized as being usable by stalkers for hunting against the Zone's creatures. \n
