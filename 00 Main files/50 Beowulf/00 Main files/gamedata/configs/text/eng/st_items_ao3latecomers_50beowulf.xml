		<text>The Beowulf M4 is a fully automatic variant of the M4 carbine chambered in .50 Beowulf. The round is intended to improve stopping power greatly at short- to medium-range as compared to the standard 5.56x45mm NATO round. One of its advertised uses is at vehicle checkpoints, since the heavy bullet's flight path is not easily deflected by auto glass or standard vehicle body panels. Although much has been written about its tactical uses, the .50 Beowulf is gaining recognition as a sporting cartridge. It is becoming more widely recognized as being usable by stalkers for hunting against the Zone's creatures. \n

		<text>The HK416 is a rifle designed and manufactured by Heckler &amp; Koch to improve the M4. It is available as a complete firearm, or as an upper receiver that fits on any AR-15 type lower receiver. The US Army's Delta Force collaborated with the German arms makers to develop the new rifle. Testing the H&amp;K 416 in 2004 revealed that the piston operating system significantly reduces malfunctions while increasing the life of parts. The project was originally called the H&amp;K M4, but was changed in response to a trademark infringement suit filed by Colt Defence. Currently, it is only available to government and military organisations, hence why this assault rifle is usually carried by Mercenaries.\n

The Mk18 is in essence an M4A1 carbine outfitted with Close Quarter Battle Receiver (CQBR) - a replacement upper receiver featuring a 10.3" (262mm) barrel. The shorter barrel makes the weapon significantly more compact and easier to use in and around vehicles and tight confined spaces. The Mk18 is praised for its light weight and short dimensions, making it very easy to handle. It has its drawbacks, however. The short barrel provides insufficient velocity for the bullet to display ideal wounding characteristics. Nonetheless, the Mk18 is a very good weapon in its niche and while it lacks universality of 14"-20"-barreled rifles it remains highly effective when used in suitable situations.\n
		This specific gun has been further specialized for CQC operations, featuring a 60 round quad stack magazine, increased rate of fire, and holographic sight. These features have increased its weight and decreased handling, though the increased firepower more than makes up for the cost.\n
