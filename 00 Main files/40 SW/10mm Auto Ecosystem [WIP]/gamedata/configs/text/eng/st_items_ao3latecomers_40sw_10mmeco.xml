		It features a semi-automatic blowback action combined with a 16.25-inch barrel, capable of getting the most bang for your buck out of the powerful 10mm Auto cartridge. Ample picatinny rails real estate allows for an easy installation of a variety of different sights, optics and other attachments. Thanks to that, it is a versatile firearm that can be used for a variety of different purposes, including hunting, personal defense, and recreational shooting.\n
		The Aero is designed to be very easy to modify to use any ammo, and this particular rifle has been chambered for .40 S&W. It won't have the kick of larger calibers, but if you have a preference for that ammo, it will ensure your shots land where you need them to.\n
