		<text>The AK-15 is a variant of the AK-12 chambered in 7.62x39, allowing for the use of standard AK-47 and AKM magazines. Like the base AK-12, the rifle comes standard with Picatinny rails, an adjustable telescoping stock and the rear sight has been moved to the back of the receiver. The rifle has a new muzzle brake and improved rifling, making it more accurate than other AK-47 variants. Its main drawbacks are the higher recoil and heavier weight compared to its 5.45x39 cousin.\n
