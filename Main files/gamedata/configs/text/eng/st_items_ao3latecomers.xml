		<text>The AK-15 is a variant of the AK-12 chambered in 7.62x39, allowing for the use of standard AK-47 and AKM magazines. Like the base AK-12, the rifle comes standard with Picatinny rails, an adjustable telescoping stock and the rear sight has been moved to the back of the receiver. The rifle has a new muzzle brake and improved rifling, making it more accurate than other AK-47 variants. Its main drawbacks are the higher recoil and heavier weight compared to its 5.45x39 cousin.\n

		<text>The Beowulf M4 is a fully automatic variant of the M4 carbine chambered in .50 Beowulf. The round is intended to improve stopping power greatly at short- to medium-range as compared to the standard 5.56x45mm NATO round. One of its advertised uses is at vehicle checkpoints, since the heavy bullet's flight path is not easily deflected by auto glass or standard vehicle body panels. Although much has been written about its tactical uses, the .50 Beowulf is gaining recognition as a sporting cartridge. It is becoming more widely recognized as being usable by stalkers for hunting against the Zone's creatures. \n
